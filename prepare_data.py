"""
Download Alpaca training data and MT-bench evaluation prompts.

Optional: the class-shared copy already exists at
    /project2/saifhash_1190/data/alpaca_500.json
    /project2/saifhash_1190/data/mt_bench_prompts.json

You only need to run this script if you want to re-download the data to a
different location (e.g. your own machine). Requires the `datasets` package:
    pip install datasets

Usage:
    python prepare_data.py                         # default: ./data/
    python prepare_data.py --output-dir /tmp/data  # custom location
